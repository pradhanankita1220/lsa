Theory:

SSH stands for “Secure Shell”. It is a protocol used to securely connect to a remote server/system. ssh is secure in the sense that it transfers the data in encrypted form between the host and the client.
It transfers inputs from the client to the host and relays back the output. ssh runs at TCP/IP port 22.
